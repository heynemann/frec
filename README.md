====================================================================================

frec is a service that builds a database of recognizable faces upon time.

disclaimer
----------

frec uses the [AT&T Database of
Faces](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html) for
testing the service. It is free and available to anyone and credit goes to AT&T
Laboratories Cambridge.

facerec
-------

frec is based on the incredible work done by [Philipp
Wagner](https://github.com/bytefish) in his
[facerec](https://github.com/bytefish/facerec) project.

algorithms
----------

frec draws on the work of many bright individuals. These are some papers and or
reference work that helped us along the way:

* [Enhanced Local Texture Feature Sets for Face Recognition Under DifÔ¨Åcult Lighting Conditions](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/pubs/2007/TT07/Tan-amfg07a.pdf) - by Xiaoyang Tan and Bill Triggs
* [Face Detection using LBP features](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2008/Jo-FaceDetectionUsingLBPfeatures.pdf) - by Jo Chang-yeon

math
----

frec uses some math and these are articles that might help:

* [Euclidean Distance - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
